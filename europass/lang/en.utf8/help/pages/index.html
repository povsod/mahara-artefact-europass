<h3>What is Europass</h3>
<p>Whether you are planning to enrol in an education or training programme, looking for a job, or getting experience abroad, it is important to be able to make your skills and competences clearly understood.</p>

<h3>Europass is a new way of helping people to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>make their skills and qualifications clearly and easily understood in Europe (European Union, EFTA/EEA and candidate countries);</li>
<li>move anywhere in Europe.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Europass consists of five documents:</h3>
<ul>
<li>two documents (<b>Europass curriculum vitae (CV)</b> and <b>Europass Language Passport</b>) you can fill in yourself; and</li>
<li>three other documents (<b>Europass Certificate Supplement</b>, <b>Europass Diploma Supplement</b> and <b>Europass Mobility</b>) filled in and issued by competent organisations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Europass is supported by a network of <a title="National Europass Centres" href="http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/europass/home/vernav/Information+and++Support/National+Europass+Centres.csp">National Europass Centres</a>.</p>
<p>Europass has been established by the <b>Decision No 2241/2004/EC</b> of the European Parliament and the Council of 15 December 2004 on a single transparency framework for qualifications and competences.</p>
